## 1. Entropy

The entropy S denotes the numbr of microstates $\Omega$ of a system:
$S = k ln(\Omega)$
Examples:
N-fold coin toss $\Omega = 2$

**EXAMPLE**
A pre-progremmed nanoparticle release cascade
Aim #1: The nanoparticle (NP, for example, a drug carrier) should only be released, if the carrier matrix gets in contact with the human body.
Aim #2: NP-species should be released sequentially, and from bottom to top

mechanism #1: when incubated with DNA strands, silver nanoparticles (cationic) form microggregates which cannot escape from the gel matrix.

However, these stable aggregates can be disintegrated by the addition of NaCl. Then, not only the silver NPs but also the DNA strands are mobilized.
