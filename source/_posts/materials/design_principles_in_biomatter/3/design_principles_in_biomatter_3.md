## 1. How to generate order in the micro world?

Attempt 1: Using electrostatics - 정전기학 (through a combination of cation)

Attempt 2: Again via electrostatics(정전기학); this time, however, using assymmetric 'Janus' like particles

## 2. Nanostructuring using complementarye DNA sequences

CdSe-Nanocrystals
Variant #1: fully complementary sequences
ATG / TAC
Variant #2: employing a matrix strand (similar to the translation process)
ATG + CCG -> TACGGC

## 3. Compenents required for DNA orgami

- **backbone**
  long, single stranded DNA
  biological origin

- **clamps**
  short, single stranded DNA pieces
  synthetic
  sequence can be chosen

### Step 1: Design

- Basic idea:
- A **clamp molecule** generally refers to a molecule that plays a role in stabilizing or holding together two or more entities, such as DNA, proteins, or other molecular structures.

### Step 2: Hybridization (refers to the process of combining two or more different atoms, molecules, or organisms to create a new structure or characteristic.)

- mixing -> long period of cooling (hybridization)
